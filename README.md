## Description:
This is an assignment of Health Covid-19 declaration form.

## Pages:
- [Declaration Form Page](https://d3lv5b8kbc2vs1.cloudfront.net)
- [Declaration List Page](https://d3lv5b8kbc2vs1.cloudfront.net/list)

## Design Ideas:
1. Analyse and confirm the requirements.
1. Languages and tools consideration:
    1. Since it is an interview assignment, the languages and tools used in the assignment will be in the list of the job requirements.
    1. The convenience of using the same languages will not be considered since the target of the assignment is to show the skillset of the developer.
1. System architecture consideration:
    1. Scalability
    1. Availability
    1. Reliability
    1. Maintainability
1. Design the UI for the application.
1. Start working after the analysis.
